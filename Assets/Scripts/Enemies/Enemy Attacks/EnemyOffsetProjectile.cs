    // Like above, you replace Monobehavior with the class you use as a superclass.
    // Private functions and variables are not inherited. USE PROTECTED.
    // Superclass marks functions that can be overriden with Virtual.
    // Inheriting class uses the keyword Override for modifying an existing function.
    // I do not wish to change Start or Update, so they are absent.
